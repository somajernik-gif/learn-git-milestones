# PART 1 - Git Basics

Learn to install and configure Git, then perform basic version control operations while creating a simple website.

Also see: [PART 2 - Git Collaboration](git-collaboration.md)

## Instructions

1. Complete the below steps, adding content in the [completions](#completions) table when ✏️ prompted
1. Review course content as needed. You may need to read the documentation as well.
1. After you finish, celebrate your Git proficiency! 🙌










## 1. Install and Configure Git

Follow [these instructions](./how-to/install-configure.md)







## 2. Fork this repository

If you're new to Markdown, start with this [Markdown Introduction](./how-to/markdown.md). Then create a Github account and make your first commit on Github.com

1. [Create a Github account](https://github.com/join)
1. Fork this [learn-git-milestones](https://github.com/omundy/learn-git-milestones) repository (click the Fork button, top right).
1. ✏️ Edit this `README.md` file (click the pencil icon on the Github.com page) and add your *1st* favorite emoji to the **Completed** column in appropriate row in the [completions [2-1]](#completions) section, below.
1. Commit your changes to this file to the `main` branch with the message `commit #1 from Github.com`.
1. ✏️ Use [Markdown documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to add a link in [completions [2-2]](#completions). The link text should be the same as the commit message, and the url should point to the Github.com page showing the above commit.
1. ✏️ Tables can be a little tricky in Markdown. Use a search engine to find a good link explaining how to use markdown tables and paste it in the [completions [2-3]](#completions) table.
1. View the commit history and confirm your edits
1. ✏️ What does `git log` do? Add your answer to [completions [2-4]](#completions).





## 3. Git Workflow > Github Desktop

With Git installed on your computer you can perform a basic Git workflow using Github Desktop. This is the first of a few different interfaces to give you practice with Git. You've already forked and made a commit on Github.com so let's move to Github Desktop ...


### Install Github Desktop

1. Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) on your computer
1. Connect your Github account in Github Desktop

### Clone the repository

In Github Desktop, clone the fork of this repository that you made above...

1. Select File > Clone Repository > Github.com and select it ...
1. Local Path: The default location is usually fine: `/Users/<username>/Documents/Github/` (or the equivilant on Windows). You can also use a folder specific to your class name, as long as it doesn't have spaces (e.g. `critical-web-design`)
1. Click "Clone" to finish. This will save a local copy of the repository on your computer and make it available to Github Desktop.

### Use Github Desktop with VS Code

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your computer
1. In Github Desktop, open the repo in VS Code: Repository > Open in VS Code (see preferences to change your editor)
1. ✏️ In VS Code, edit this README file and add your *2nd* favorite emoji to [completions [3-1]](#completions) and save the file.
1. In Github Desktop, view/confirm your edits to the README file on the Changes tab
1. Commit your changes directly to the main branch with the message `commit #2 from Github Desktop`. 
1. Click Push origin to push your new commit to the remote repo
1. Choose Repository > View on Github.
1. Click on the README file and then click History to see the history of this file
1. Click on the above commit (`#2`) and copy the URL. Use VS Code to add it to [completions [3-2]](#completions) . Commit your change in Github Desktop.




## 4. Git Workflow > Command line (CLI)

Some folks use the CLI as their default tool for editing and publishing source code, but Github Desktop makes it much easier.

### Setup

1. In Github Desktop, ensure you are currently in the [learn-git-milestones](https://github.com/omundy/learn-git-milestones) repo you cloned above.
1. Click Repository > Open in Terminal ("Bash" in Windows) (You can change to preferred shell in Github Desktop > File > Options > Integrations)

### Use the CLI to navigate directories

1. List files in this directory: `ls`
1. List files in this directory, including hidden: `ls -la`
1. Confirm the existence of the `.git` directory (where Git versions and config are stored)
1. View your current working directory and copy the full path: `pwd`
1. ✏️ Open this README file in VS Code and paste that path in [completions [4-1]](#completions).


### Use Git on the CLI

1. [Confirm](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/setting-your-username-in-git) your name and email is correct in the Git config
1. View the status of your repo: `git status`
1. View the changed files of your repo: `git diff`
1. Add all changed files to the staging area `git add .`
1. View the status of your repo `git status` to confirm it has been staged
1. ✏️ Commit your changes with the message `commit #3 from CLI`. Add a link to this commit to [completions [4-2]](#completions).
1. Use `git push` to [push those changes to your remote repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)



You've used most of these already through a GUI (e.g. `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) ...





## 5. Create a website with Git


### Create a new repository in Github Desktop

1. Select File > New repository to create a new repository with the following... 
2. Name: `first-website`
3. Local Path: Click "Choose" and select the parent folder of the repository you cloned above (so that the new repository folder will be created next to `learn-git-milestones`, not inside of it!)

```html
<parent-folder> <-THIS!
|-- first-website 
|-- learn-git-milestones
```

4. Initialize this repository with a README? `yes`
5. Git Ignore: Select any option (we will overwrite below)
6. License: `MIT`
7. Click Create Repository



### Add a README.md

1. In Github Desktop choose Repository > Open in VS Code
1. Add a README file: `README.md`
1. In the README write your name and the date
1. Use some [Markdown tags](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)


### Add a .gitignore file

A `.gitignore` file will prevent git from adding unwanted files to your repository.

1. In VS Code, add a new file named `.gitignore`. The period in front will hide the file from the Finder (or Explorer) but it will still be visible in VS Code.
1. Copy the contents of either the [MacOS](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/33243d9491911332228307c915ff95707791a91f/Global/macOS.gitignore) or [Windows](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/33243d9491911332228307c915ff95707791a91f/Global/Windows.gitignore) `.gitignore` files and paste it into your own.
1. Commit your changes using Github Desktop. 


### Add an index.html file

1. In VS Code, create a file named `index.html` in your new repo 
2. Add the following code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>My first github.io website</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
		<p>🙌</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

3. Commit your changes using Github Desktop.


### Publish this repository on Github.

1. In Github Desktop, click "Publish this repository on Github"
1. Make sure the repository is public *not private* 
1. Click Publish Repository
1. Choose Repository > View on Github
1. ✏️ Add a link to this repo on Github to [completions [5-1]](#completions).




## 6. Publish a website with Github Pages

Now that your files are on Github you can use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a free and easy way to host a website from your repository. 

1. On Github.com, go to your repository > Settings > Pages
1. Source: Deploy from Branch
1. Branch: Select the `main` and `/(root)` folder and click Save
1. Do not use a theme. Start from scratch
1. Wait about 60 seconds and refresh the page. You will see a link at the top that says "Your site is live at..." with a URL that looks like `http://*username*.github.io/first-website`
1. Update your index.html page with VS Code, push a new commit with Github Desktop, and confirm your updates are live. You can see the status of your deployments from the link on your main repo page.
1. ✏️ Paste a link to the ***live*** (github.io) website in [completions [6-1]](#completions).



🎉 Congratulations! 🎉 You just built a website with Git and Github!!
